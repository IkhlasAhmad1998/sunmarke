        "content": "A Positive Education School\nA Philosophy Where Character Strengths Underpin Academic Excellence\nTruly outstanding education is not just about academic and personal achievements but also about the development of character, values, and wellbeing. This is the essence of Positive Education (PosEd).\nA scientifically-proven concept, PosEd is causing a paradigm shift in global education where parents, schools and governments realise the need to increase a child\u2019s \u2018wellbeing\u2019 to raise his/her levels of \u2018achievement\u2019.\nPosEd brings together the science of Positive Psychology combined with the best teaching practices to enable individuals, schools, and communities to flourish, be resilient, creative, successful and happy.\nSunmarke \u2013 A Character-Building School\nMultiple studies on the effects of PosEd testify that improved levels of a child\u2019s wellbeing are associated with higher levels of academic engagement, social skills, optimism, behaviour, and fewer mental health-related issues.\nPositive Education \u2013 Sunmarke\u2019s DNA\nPositive Education (PosEd) is not an additional subject at Sunmarke but it\u2019s woven into the fabric of the international school\u2019s culture and is reflected in all its activities and teaching mechanisms. Sunmarke\u2019s teachers undergo an intense training programme before entering the classroom where they learn, live, teach and embed Positive Education.\nThis is what our teachers say about the Positive Education training they receive at Sunmarke:\n\u201cWhere amazing happens.\u00a0 A motto that at first glance just appears to be some words to attract parents to send their children to Sunmarke school, almost like a gimmick.\u00a0 Over the past 3 days for me amazing did happen.\u00a0 \u00a0The positive education training took me on a journey of self-discovery, showing me that changing my mindset can bring positive outcomes. I realized I have the power to make a difference in people\u2019s lives. This training was the best I\u2019ve ever received from a school, as they genuinely cared about us, ensuring we could apply what we learned in teaching and at home. It was an incredible experience, especially since I used to dislike training due to its lack of usefulness. This was entirely different \u2013 truly helpful, purposeful, and enlightening. It taught me to believe in the potential of education to inspire change.\u201d\n\u201cThe breadth of knowledge, evidence-based theories, outstanding coordination and delivery, and just everything about this week was outstanding! I was blown away in every way possible and feel so supported, valued, and appreciated.\u201d\nThe \u2018Flourish\u2019 Model\nThe 6 Key Skills Practised and Taught by Sunmarke Teachers for Students to Incorporate in Their Lives\nSUNMARKE'S WELLBEING & COUNSELLING TEAM\nOur PosEd and wellbeing approach fosters deep trust in our school community, creating a safe, welcoming and nurturing environment. We embed various initiatives into the daily routines, curriculum and extracurricular activities to establish a personal, social and academic support system each child needs to flourish.\nClass and Form Tutors, Heads of Year, and Subject teachers support students every day through direct teaching, mentoring, workshops and assemblies. The \u00a0Counselling Department provides compassionate care for children who may require professional support and or simply a sympathetic listening ear.\nStudents and parents both have access to a School Counsellor. A \u2018Wellbeing Champion\u2019 represents the school leadership in our Parent Association and \u2018Friends of Sunmarke School\u2019 (FOSS) group while the popular monthly \u2018Wellness Wednesday\u2019 event raises awareness among parents about crucial topics like strength-based parenting, raising children in the digital age and health and nutrition.\nSUNMARKE'S SAFEGUARDING & CHILD PROTECTION TEAM\nSunmarke has a designated Safeguarding and Child Protection Team with Child Protection Officers at every Key Stage in primary and secondary school.\nClick here for more information on our Safeguarding & Child Protection Team\nSafeguarding & Child Protection Policy\nWe are also a certified school with the\nNational Online Safety programme benchmarked to the best school safety standards in the UK.\nPlease find more information about NOS here:\nhttps://nationalonlinesafety.com/"

Blending a range of outstanding Early Years practices from the best international schools, we commit to a child-initiated learning approach and a sophisticated play-based curriculum that enables students to fulfil their unique potential.\nSunmarke\u2019s Amazing Philosophy and Journey\nA-\nAutonomy:\nChildren are central to everything we do; all projects stem directly from their interests.\nM\n\u2013 Mindset:\nIn line with Sunmarke\u2019s \u2018Positive Education\u2019 ethos, we teach children to have a \u2018Growth Mindset\u2019, encouraging endless possibilities.\nA-\nAcademics:\nWe provide a broad, balanced yet innovative British curriculum based on the Early Years Foundation Stage, building the bedrock for the future.\nZ\n-Zest:\nHappiness is a key agenda at Sunmarke School; we truly believe that if a child is happy and enthusiastic, they learn better.\nI\n\u2013 Individuality:\nOur personalised curriculum ensures every child\u2019s individuality is recognised. Strong teacher/pupil relationships allows tutors to identify and cater to a child\u2019s interests, strengths and challenges.\nN\n\u2013 Nurture:\nWe nurture every child to enable them to grow and reach their fullest potential.\nG\n\u2013 Grow:\nEvery child that enters EYFS has a special and incredible journey that helps them grow and develop into happy, healthy teens.\nLearning Through Play\nImaginative and creative play is how children learn about the world. During imaginative play, they manipulate materials, express themselves verbally and non-verbally, plan, act, interact, react and try different roles.\nLearning is most effective when children participate in creative play with dolls, vehicles, blocks, rocks, cardboard, or boxes. Employing creative thinking while manipulating play dough, creating recipes by mixing dirt and water, working with art materials, splashing in puddles, or pretending to fly can further child development.\nImagination fosters cognitive and social development by allowing children to contemplate different resolutions, thus boosting their self-confidence.\nOur Early Years Foundation Stage has been rated as \u2018\nOutstanding\n\u2019 in the latest KHDA\u2019s DSIB inspection report (2023-24) with \u2018\nOutstanding\nPersonal Development & Learning Skills and\nOutstanding\nCurriculum and Curriculum Adaptation\u2019."

        "content": "Early Years Curriculum\nSetting The Foundation For A Fulfilling Educational Journey\nSunmarke\u2019s Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) offers a broad and balanced curriculum for our youngest students aged 3 to 5 years, once again proving its credentials as one of the best British curriculum schools in Dubai. Children acquire new skills through 7 areas of learning and development.\nIn the initial stages, three Prime Areas are in focus:\nPersonal, Social and Emotional Development\nPhysical Development\nCommunication and Language Development.\nGrowing up, the Prime Areas help develop skills in\u00a04 Specific Areas:\nLiteracy\nMathematics\nUnderstanding of the World\nExpressive Arts and Design\nLaying the Foundations for Lifelong Learning in FS1 and FS2\nAt Sunmarke, our Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), comprising\nFS1 (Nursery)\nand\nFS2 (Reception)\n, offers a broad, balanced, and enriching curriculum for children aged 3 to 5. Rooted in the British curriculum and recognised as one of Dubai\u2019s leading EYFS providers, our programme nurtures each child\u2019s unique strengths and interests through play-based, inquiry-led learning.\nA Curriculum Designed Around the Whole Child\nThe EYFS curriculum at FS1 and FS2 is structured around seven key areas of learning and development:\nPrime Areas (Early Focus):\nPersonal, Social and Emotional Development\nPhysical Development\nCommunication and Language\nThese areas are particularly emphasised in\nFS1\n, helping our youngest learners develop the essential foundations of confidence, relationships, movement, and communication.\nSpecific Areas (Building on the Foundations):\nLiteracy\nMathematics\nUnderstanding the World\nExpressive Arts and Design\nAs children progress into\nFS2\n, these specific areas become more prominent, supporting emerging literacy and numeracy skills, creative expression, and a growing awareness of the world.\nCharacteristics of Effective Learning\nAcross FS1 and FS2, we recognise that children learn in different ways. The EYFS framework promotes three key learning characteristics:\nPlaying and Exploring:\nInvestigating and experiencing, \u2018having a go\u2019\nActive Learning:\nConcentrating, persevering, and celebrating achievement\nCreating and Thinking Critically:\nDeveloping ideas, making connections, and problem-solving\nThese traits guide how learning is planned and delivered across both FS1 and FS2, ensuring that each child\u2019s development is supported in a way that reflects their interests, needs, and learning styles.\nLearning Through Play and Projects\nAt Sunmarke, we view\nplay\nas a powerful vehicle for learning in both FS1 and FS2. Our curriculum is intentionally designed to offer rich, purposeful play experiences that allow children to explore, imagine, and make sense of the world in a way that is meaningful to them.\nIn\nFS1\n, children are encouraged to investigate through hands-on exploration, sensory play, and open-ended experiences that develop early communication, social, and physical skills. As they transition into\nFS2\n, children engage in more structured yet still playful learning that builds early literacy and numeracy skills while continuing to promote creativity and curiosity.\nOur\nproject-based learning\napproach further enhances engagement. Each term, both FS1 and FS2 children explore exciting, inquiry-led themes such as\n\u201cI Believe I Can Fly,\u201d \u201cSomewhere Out There,\u201d\nand\n\u201cUp, Up and Away.\u201d\nThese projects spark imagination and are shaped by the children\u2019s own interests and questions, creating a deep sense of ownership and wonder.\nWhether FS1 children are building a fairy tale castle or FS2 pupils are investigating the planets, our environments are carefully curated to provide challenge, joy, and discovery. Through child-initiated and adult-guided activities, children develop critical thinking, collaboration, and communication\u2014the building blocks of future learning.\nA Holistic and Nurturing Approach\nAt Sunmarke, we believe that every child in FS1 and FS2 is a unique individual. Our holistic approach to early education goes beyond academics to nurture each child\u2019s emotional, social, physical, and intellectual development.\nWe incorporate globally respected early years methodologies including elements of the\nReggio Emilia philosophy\n,\nMontessori principles\n, and the\nCuriosity Approach\n. This eclectic framework values child-led exploration, independence, and a strong connection to the learning environment\u2014creating rich opportunities for discovery and expression.\nOur learning spaces are thoughtfully designed to be calm, beautiful, and engaging, reflecting the importance of the environment as the \u2018third teacher\u2019. Teachers and support staff observe closely, respond sensitively, and plan responsively to extend learning in authentic, meaningful ways.\nStrong partnerships with parents, a passionate team of educators, and a shared belief in the limitless potential of every child create a warm, supportive community. In FS1 and FS2, children feel safe, seen, and inspired\u2014laying a confident foundation for their journey through school and life.\nCharacteristics of Effective Learning\nThe\u00a0characteristics of Effective Learning\u00a0describe how children learn and respond to teaching in the Foundation Stage, a factor determined by their individual learning characteristic. Three traits of effective teaching and learning identified by the EYFS are:\nPlaying and Exploring:\nFinding out, discovering, willing to \u2018have a go\u2019 and playing with what they know\nActive Learning:\nBeing involved and concentrating, trying and persevering, taking pleasure from achievements\nCreating and Thinking Critically:\nDeveloping their own ideas, making links and selecting their own ways to complete tasks\n7 Curriculum Areas\nTo enhance the learning experience and make it impactful, Sunmarke has selected 7 curriculum areas taught through unique projects and interests, most of which are child-initiated activities that incorporate elements of imagination, investigation and \u2018out of the box\u2019 ideas, concepts and solutions.\nThe EYFS curriculum is designed and based on the philosophy of learning through play which enhances critical thinking abilities, fuels risk-taking and creative skills.\nExamples of topics are \u2018I believe I can fly\u2019, \u2018Somewhere out there\u2019 and \u2018Up up and away.\u2019 The initiative EYFS curriculum is designed and based on the philosophy of learning through play.\nOur teaching philosophy is designed to treat all children as unique individuals in their own right. Our holistic approach towards education ensures that parents/carers, class teachers, specialist teachers and learning assistants work very effectively together to support our firm belief that \u2018every child is unique\u2019.\nOur maxim is that happy and well-motivated children are good learners. The Foundation Stage is a safe, secure and friendly environment for our youngest children to gain confidence and independence, as they prepare for the next stage of schooling. It is a foundation for future learning.\nCharacteristics of Effective Learning (CoEL) are a revived element in the current Early Years Foundation Stage Curriculum (EYFS). CoEL advocates that while planning and guiding children\u2019s activities, practitioners must reflect on the different ways that students learn, and these lessons must be reflected in their practice."

Our transition programme from Primary to Secondary school ensures that they start Year 7 full of excitement and with minimal nervousness.\nThis section contains important and up-to-date information about our transition programme. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact Ms Young (Deputy Head \u2013 Student Opportunity) or Mr Matthews (Head of Year 7).\nTransitioning Into Secondary\nWe strive to do our utmost to ensure that the transition from Year 6 to Year\u00a0 7 is as smooth and welcoming as possible.\nDays for Your Diary\nUpcoming activities:\nSecondary pastoral leaders visit Year 6 children in their classrooms to hold informal Q&A sessions.\nParent Coffee Mornings are held in Term Two and Three to learn more about the Secondary School and how to support your children with the transition process. This is an opportunity to meet key members of staff such as the Secondary Leadership Team.\nDuring the summer term, children will have the opportunity to experience Secondary Taster lessons. This will give them the chance to meet some of our secondary school staff and experience this part of the school building.\nMore information and timings for the above events will be available soon via VLE.\nApproach To Learning In Secondary\nOur approach encourages students to build the skills and learning habits to become independent thinkers \u2013 preparing them for life way beyond Year 13.\nThinking Skills\nAt Sunmarke through our \u2018Positive Education\u2019 inclusive approach, students are enabled to flourish in a safe, happy and nurturing learning environment. They are stretched and challenged to ask and develop their own questions to harness their potential to the maximum.\nOpportunities are provided through numerous activities undertaken in the classroom, on the sports field,\u00a0 on stage, through educational visits abroad, organising charity events, or representing the school as outstanding ambassadors.\nLeadership\nThere are numerous opportunities for leadership from informal roles within the classroom to formal roles outside of the classroom e.g. Prefects, School and Community Ambassadors.\nStudents can aspire to leadership roles within and outside their year groups.\u00a0 These roles are designed to promote excellence while enabling student leaders to play a role in the development of the school and community.\nThe Student Hub within the Secondary School is a dedicated space for secondary students to meet with their Student Leadership Team. At Sunmarke we believe in student voice and the sharing of ideas. The Hub provides a platform for every student to be heard and to interact with their Student Leaders.\nDigital Learning\nSunmarke students are adept at using technology through\u00a0 class assignment and quizzes, home learning, submission and assessments, online collaboration and communication between students and teachers, tracking progress and behaviour and access to school resources, library books and information.\nWe promote and sustain a culture that encourages the integration of digital technologies into all areas of the curriculum. Students engage and collaborate with their peers using a variety of digital environments and tools.\nCyber-safety is an integral part of how the school community works with everyone being aware of their digital responsibilities, modelling ethical and appropriate use of digital resources.\nPlease view our Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)\nhere\n.\nSocial Responsibility\nOur principled, creative and innovative learning environment encourages students to have a responsibility \u2018for\u2019 and \u2018towards\u2019 the community.\u00a0 They learn to be solution-focused, discuss controversial topics, share their opinions on what they learn, ask questions and engage in dialogue.\nEnvironment and Sustainability\nSustainability is a key agenda at Sunmarke School. We believe that we have a shared responsibility as citizens of the world to choose sustainable practices and we empower our students to do the same.\nBelow are just some of the ways we incorporate the environment and sustainability within our subjects.\nMedia\n\u2013 Sunmarke\u2019s Media students focus on projects related to sustainable transportation, the effects of pollution and draw upon the beauty of nature and landscapes when building their portfolios.\nEconomics\n\u2013 Our Business and Economics courses cover topics such as economic growth vs development, effects of trade and globalisation, the impact of deforestation etc. Students are encouraged to research policies to solve urgent environmental issues.\nThe Sciences \u2013\nA Level and IB Biology \u2013 Both courses include the study of ecosystems, ecology and biodiversity. Secondary students also look into the sustainability of using earth\u2019s resources and assess the impact of extracting, using and recycling.\nGlobal Outlook\nOur excellent, holistic education and team of dedicated teachers place values like honesty, responsibility, tolerance and respect for the rights of others irrespective of nationality, gender, culture or religion at the foundation of learning.\nThis provides students the skills and knowledge to meet the challenges of the future. Our\u00a0 high-quality education and multi-pathway model with bespoke career paths guide them to find the most appropriate route to study their favourite subjects at the university of their choice."

As an inclusive school, Sunmarke offers a wide range of options at Key Stage 4. Through offering GCSE, IGCSE, and BTEC courses, we are able to accommodate a wide range of learning styles, whilst ensuring the level of challenge is such that all post-16 pathways remain open to students.\nGCSE examinations are the mainstay of an English education, with most students following this pathway. At Sunmarke we also offer IGCSE examinations; the \u2018I\u2019 stands for international and means the course has been adapted to suit a more international student body. The difficulty level of GCSE and IGCSE exams are the same, but the content of GCSE examinations is more English-centred. A good example of this would be in Business Studies where the case studies for a GCSE would be UK companies, which many of our students would not have heard of. This is why we follow the IGCSE pathway for Business Studies, meaning the case studies focus on large multi-national companies all our students would know.\nBTEC courses are as challenging as GCSE course but are assessed in a different manner. All BTEC courses are coursework based, with students undertaking assessed units every 12 weeks or so, these are all graded, and the outcome is the sum of these assessments. BTEC courses suit students who prefer to \u2018chunk\u2019 their assessments rather than taking one or two summative exams at the end of the course which determine their final outcome.\nCompulsory subjects and options choices\nAll students study the core subjects of English, Mathematics, Science, Arabic, Games and Moral, Social Cultural Studies.

Through our different pathways, we encourage students to ask questions about the world around them and think from multiple perspectives.\nWe are unique in offering A-Levels, BTECs, and being an IB World School, we also offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. Whether students choose the A-Level, BTEC; or the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme pathway, we inspire purpose and drive passion.\nHere at Sunmarke we care about the journey that students go on and the skills they develop along the way. Our students are not defined by grades, they are a collection of skills and interests that show their passion,\u00a0and we want them to strive to be better learners to best prepare them for the path they choose after they graduate. Students will develop these skills through sessions run in form time on developing as a\u00a0learner and preparing for higher education. While attending sessions for the latter, students will be exposed to resources that will help them explore their passions through reading, videos and courses outside of the\u00a0curriculum that are now available online at the click of a button.\nOutside of the form room is where you will differ in terms of skills developed. The International Baccalaureate Programmes places more of an emphasis in developing a variety of skills due to the diverse subjects students have to take whereas A-Levels allow students to delve deeper into a smaller selection of subjects. Different still are BTEC qualifications which have no exams and will, therefore, develop your investigation and research skills as you look to answer your briefs.\nLeadership\nAll students at Sunmarke\u2019s Sixth Form are leaders and role models and they embrace this responsibility fully. These young leaders play a crucial role in the growth of the school and the community.\nWithin their academics, students are provided options to lead their own learning such as through the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ), available to A Level and BTEC students or through various pieces of coursework, such as the Extended Essay and Reflective Project on the International Baccalaureate pathways.\nThere are several opportunities for students to assume leadership roles,\u00a0 form their own extra-curricular activities and represent the school as\u00a0Senior Prefects,\u00a0Senior Student Leadership Team, House Captains and Subject Ambassadors.\nThinking Skills\nPreparing\nstudents to flourish in an environment that encourages critical and independent thinking, Sunmarke\u2019s Sixth Form is imbued with the Positive Education approach. Students are trained through the Theory of Knowledge (TOK) curriculum that motivates them to ask questions about the world around them and think from multiple perspectives.\nDigital Learning\nSixth Form students model the use and integration of digital technologies throughout their curriculum. Many digital tools are available such as Questia School, an online library and UniFrog, a platform for search, shortlist and applying for university courses.\nSixth Form Students are taught to be at ease with technology, but also encouraged to question its validity, reliability and responsibility in a modern world. Media literacy is given a lot of importance at Sunmarke as students prepare to navigate the world beyond the school.\nPlease view our Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy\nhere\n.\nSocial Responsibility\nSunmarke Sixth Formers take the lead in service, learning and providing solutions while developing collaboration, leadership and social skills.\nThere are structured programmes for students to follow such as CAS (Creativity, Activity, Service) and Service Learning that lists a set of objectives to be used as guidance.\nThese are \u2018need and solution-based\u2019 programmes where students can choose to give service to their peers, the school, the local community and even make a global difference. These programmes make them understand the difference they can make to the world while developing emotional intelligence.\nGlobal Outlook\nAs an international school training students to excel globally, we foster an ethos of honesty, responsibility, tolerance and respect for others within the academic and Positive Education curriculum.\nSixth Form students take a leading role in celebrations such as International Day by sharing their own cultures and traditions with the rest of the community. As a multi-pathway school, we aim to make our students global citizens.\nKey Stage 4 Options Booklet\nSunmarke has designed the below listed booklet to give information to our students about the courses they could study in Years 10 and 11. These are useful as a guide to choose the right options and also serve as a reference point throughout the two year IGCSE, GCSE or BTEC Level 2 programmes. It gives a glimpse of the areas of study within each subject that can be used to support the teaching and learning.\nSunmarke parents can view the PDF version of the Key Stage 4 Options Booklet from our parent communication portal, VLE.\nClick here to view the Key Stage 4 Options Booklet\nSixth Form Options Booklet\nWe have designed the below booklet to inform and support our students on the multiple pathways available to them. We are unique in offering A Levels, BTECs, and being an IB world school, we also offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme and the International Baccalaureate Career Related Programme. It is therefore, important to understand each one to make an informed decision.\nSunmarke parents can view the PDF version of the Sixth Form Options Booklet from our parent communication portal, VLE.\nClick here to view the Sixth Form Options Booklet"

        "content": "A-Levels\nAn Internationally Recognised Qualification Focusing On Content-Driven Academic Subjects\nWhy study A-Levels?\nAdvanced Level qualifications (known as A-Levels) are individual subject based qualifications. They are one option available to students who are looking to study at university. With A-Levels being standalone qualifications, there is no requirement on subject combinations and students\u2019 only constraint is the combinations available within the school timetable. A-Levels are graded from A*-E.\nWhat does this Pathway look like?\nStudents will usually take 3 or 4 A-Levels and this would be what universities would be looking for as offers are based mainly on 3 A-Level grades. If you are debating which subjects to choose, we recommend you start with 4 A-Levels so you can have a range to begin with which you can narrow down later. Students will receive 6 lessons per subject each week with most subjects being 100% examination-based. Subjects either fit into the category of modular A-Levels or linear A-Levels. In modular subjects, students will take up to three exams in Year 12 and up to three in Year 13 whereas, with linear A-Levels, students complete all exams at the end of Year 13.\nHow does this Pathway lead to University?\nA-Levels are internationally recognised qualifications which will give you access to the most competitive universities worldwide. While taking A-Levels would give you the necessary prerequisites with regards to subjects, you may need to take further tests in English in order to study at universities where courses are delivered in English. In addition, students wishing to study certain subjects worldwide need to review the Mathematics requirements for entry into the university of their choice.\nWhat skills will I develop?\nTaking a combination of A-Levels will allow you to specialise in a particular area post 16 as opposed to waiting until you begin university. With few subjects having coursework components, there is a lot of focus\u00a0on exam skills. However, there is the option of taking the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) in order to develop your academic writing and research skills. Furthermore, the EPQ is a perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate and develop your interest in an area you want to go on to study at university; competitive universities are always looking for examples of students pursuing their academic passions outside of the classroom. Whether it be the other EPQ or another opportunity, we recommend you find an outlet to explore your passions through extra-curricular activities."

        "content": "BTECs\nA Dynamic BTEC Programme Helping Students Develop Vocational Skills To Move To University Or Into Direct Employment\nWhat are BTECs?\nShort for Business and Technology Education Council, BTECs are a practical-based, vocational qualification which offers the same equivalence to A-Levels when converted into UCAS points. Many industry sectors have a set of National Occupational Standards that professionals must follow. The learning content of BTECs is built around these National Occupational Standards, which is why BTECs are recognised as valuable qualifications. They provide the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in a field or subject and are an excellent alternative to the more theory focused A-Levels or subjects on the IB Diploma Programme.\nWhat does this Pathway look like?\nBTECs are taught through application with students often going on educational visits and meeting industry specialists as well as completing one week of work experience in Year 12. Assessments are via regular\u00a0coursework and projects throughout the 2-year course. If you know you don\u2019t excel in exam conditions, BTECs can relieve this pressure, spreading out the work that dictates your final grade as 100% of your final grade will come from these coursework components. Students are able to take a combination of BTECs and A-Levels in order to have a balance between hands on learning whilst also taking more traditional\u00a0subjects.\nHow does this Pathway lead to University?\nBTECs are equivalent to A-Levels in terms of applications to universities. However, there are some universities which don\u2019t accept these qualifications so you would need to research the different countries\u00a0you would like to apply for in order to ensure you meet the admissions criteria for your desired destination.\nWhat skills will I develop?\nBTECs truly prepare students for the real world, offering them practical skills to be successful in the industry of their choosing. If you enjoy practical learning and want to study a specialised range of subjects, BTECs are the perfect option for you. Within each subject, more technical skills are developed; for example, we are very proud of our BTEC Media courses that allow students to create using hi-tech equipment as students learn how to get the most out of this technology."

Find out more about the details of the IB Diploma Programme at Sunmarke.\nWhat is the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme?\nThe International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) is a holistic programme which gives you a broad post 16 education whilst also allowing you to specialise in three subjects. You will take three\u00a0Standard Level subjects and three Higher Level subjects as well as the Extended Essay, Theory of Knowledge and the Creativity, Activity and Service Programme (CAS). Each subject is graded from 1-7 with the diploma core (Theory of Knowledge and Extended Essay) giving 3 more points depending on the combination of grades in these components. Students must achieve a minimum total of 24 points to pass the Diploma\u00a0Programme.\nWhat does this Pathway look like?\nEach week you will receive lessons in your 6 subjects (typically 4 lessons for higher level and 3 for standard level) as well as lessons in Theory of Knowledge (TOK). You will also receive sessions to develop writing and research skills needed for the Extended Essay. This is a piece of academic writing where you choose the subject, topic and research question to produce an answer in a 4,000 word research report. The CAS programme is a non-graded component which encourages students to set objectives in creative, active and service experiences outside of the classroom. Each subject has a coursework component worth at\u00a0least 20% meaning the whole grade does not rest on the final exams.\nHow does this Pathway lead to University?\nAn internationally recognised qualification, the IBDP will give you access to the most competitive universities worldwide. With the DP developing more than just subject knowledge, universities see it as a\u00a0perfect higher education preparation programme. As all students study English Language and Literature, you will meet the language requirement of most universities that deliver courses in English. The IBDP\u00a0programme also continues a student\u2019s study in Mathematics. Students completing the IBDP programme continue to study Mathematics and English throughout their Secondary education and are then able to\u00a0demonstrate 4 years of study in Mathematics and English during the application process. The IB Diploma, due to its holistic nature and its requirements, is highly valued by universities worldwide.\nWhat skills will I develop?\nThrough coursework components, the Extended Essay and Theory of Knowledge, you will learn to think critically, write well constructed, balanced arguments and write using an academic structure. The CAS programme develops skills to ensure you are a well-rounded student who has lots of experiences beyond the classroom to make you really stand out in university applications and interviews.\nIB Diploma Programme courses options on offer at Sunmarke:\nEnglish Language & Literature\nEnvironmental Systems and Societies\nFrench\nSpanish\nPsychology\nBusiness Management\nVisual Arts\nEconomics\nPhysics\nBiology\nChemistry\nMaths: Analysis & Approaches\nMaths: Application & Interpretation\nFilm\n\u00a9 International Baccalaureate Organization 2018\nAt the core of the IB Programmes is a focus on teaching and learning, and the IB Learner Profile. The IB Learner Profile is a set of traits which the IB believes students must develop to meet the mission\u2019s long-term goal. Throughout the two years of the programme, teachers will promote these attributes in lessons to help students become better learners which will enhance their academic journey and prepare them to be more independent after graduating from school. Below are the 10 traits that make up the IB Learner Profile."

It\u2019s an impartial, user-friendly platform that helps students to research their future pathways.\nIt contains a repository of career lessons, information on pathways, universities around the world, CV builder, personality tests, and links to MOOCs (online courses).\nUnifrog is useful for students in their last four years of study but can be accessed and used by all in Secondary. Students can use the platform to start to explore the different post 18 pathways and the application process for their chosen route.\nCareers lessons in Y12 focus on psychometric testing, university and career research and to start working on application requirements such as personal statements and US university essays.\nWe encourage all families to explore this platform together as early as possible in order to start the conversation as to where a student may study as well as what the course requirements are in order to make sure the right combination of subjects are being chosen post 16. There are many factors that go into shortlisting universities such as location, size, tuition fees or university housing to name just a few; with all this choice, it is important to narrow down to specific countries in Year 12 so the application process is not overwhelming in Year 13.\nStudents work one-on-one with the university careers counsellors who assist and guide students through every step of the application process.\nUniversity Destinations\nSunmarke students achieve their first choice university destinations which has included UK Russel Group schools, and top Worldwide destinations such as the Imperial College London, NYU, University of Amsterdam, Bocconi, Carnegie Mellon, UCLA, UC San Diego, Georgia Tech, The University of Toronto, McGill and University of Edinburgh.

My son was enroled in FS1 this year but I withdrew his enrolment due to COVID-19. He\u2019ll be 3 years old in September. Can I still enrol him in FS2 next year?\nYour child must have formally finished the previous academic year in order to enrol in the next one. Since he does not meet the age requirement for FS2 for next academic year, he must enrol in FS1. According to the MOE resolution, he can enrol in FS2 next academic year only if he completes FS1 this academic year.\n8. My daughter will be 4 years old in December. If I enrol her in FS2 for the last term of this year \u2013 before the changes come into effect \u2013 will she be able to start Year 1 next year?\nYes. The new age requirements will apply for new students from the start of the next academic year only. The MOE resolution stipulates that all students currently enroled at private schools in the UAE are not affected by the change.\n9. I\u2019ve already registered and paid the deposit for my daughter to start school in FS2 in September. She will be four years old in November. Is she affected by this?\nAccording to the new cut-off dates in the MOE resolution, your daughter will not be able to start in FS2 in September. Alternatively, we would be happy to transfer your child\u2019s application to their age-appropriate year group (FS1) and register your child for this year group instead.\nParents whose children are affected by the new cut-off dates and who have already paid deposits for their children\u2019s enrolment are entitled to a refund if they wish.\n10. My child was born one day after the cut-off date. Is there some leeway given?\nNo exceptions to the cut-off dates will be given under any circumstances\nHow do I book Assessments for entry 2025-26 AY?\nAdmissions are now open for applications for 2025-26 AY* entry.\nThe 2025-2026 Assessment Diary is Open \u2013 We are now booking assessments for year groups FS1 & FS2, Year 1 to 10 and Year 12.\nPlease contact the Sunmarke Admissions Office to confirm your child\u2019s assessment date.\nFor students currently overseas: For students in current Year 6 and above we can offer Assessment at the current school attended.\nPlease contact us to find out more. Students transferring from UK schools in all years, please contact us directly for more details.\nCan my child be assessed before arriving into Dubai?\nFor Students entering Year 7 and above, assessment can be offered at the current school attended if that school is willing to administer the test under examination conditions.\nThe assessment will be the same as that taken by our local students with the addition of a Skype interview.\nYou will need to provide registration, a letter of enrolment, the latest school report, and a recommendation form by the date of assessment.\nFor students transferring from UK schools please contact admissions directly to discuss your application.\nWhat are the tuition fees for FS1- Year 13 (2025-26)?\nTuition Fees\nClick here to view the\nTuition Fees: New Students \u2013 FS1 to Year 13 \u2013 2025-26\nWhat are the KHDA document fees?\nTariff for the following KHDA services as stipulated by KHDA:\nRequest for student Education Continuation Certificate for visa renewal (AED 120)\nRequest for student leaving form for the students who are leaving Dubai (AED 120)\nRequest for student transfer between private schools (within the stipulated time frame)-Student transfer (AED 120)\nCan my child with special education needs attend Sunmarke school?\nAt\u00a0Sunmarke, we exercise a positive and inclusive admissions policy. Candidates will each be given due consideration on a case-by-case basis, and we will take into account the capacity of the premises, staff and curriculum pathways to effectively meet the needs of the individual.\nOur Achievement Centre offers a broad range of additional support for students with SEND, including targeted support in\u00a0language, maths, literacy, and functional independence. We are currently working to develop our range of alternative curriculum pathways for Key Stages 2, 3, and 4 so that, in time, we can offer an appropriate pathway for every learner.\nWhat is Year 7 and Year 8 Life skills Pathway?\n1. Is it approved by the Ministry of Education?\nIt is a mainstream curriculum, supplemented by ASDAN modules. As it is a supplemented curriculum which focuses on reduced teachers, as per KHDA, there is no need for permission for this pathway as it falls under our current education licence.\n2. What are the timings if my son is enroled in this program?\nThe timings are that of the normal school day, unless the student has additional needs or commitments outside of school that need to be met. As a KHDA accredited Rahhal provider, we can review timings to meet the student\u2019s needs.\n3. What is the cost for LSA?\nCosts are an estimate range until all students are enroled.\n4. What would be mentioned in the invoice for this program? Is it \u201cTuition fee\u201d?\nSchool fees are billed as normal. Parents will then have to sign a KHDA Individual Service Agreement for the LSA cost. This will then be a separate invoice.\n5 How will I enrol my child?\nOur SENCO will assess the student before we can accept to ensure we can meet their needs in this class. It is a pathway that supports access to the mainstream and we can\u2019t cater for severe needs.\nFor more information on the pathway, please\nclick here\nWhat is the Assessment, Registration, and Re-enrolment fees for Regent International School students transferring to Sunmarke School?\nWhat is the Assessment, Registration, and Re-enrolment fees for Regent International School students transferring to Sunmarke School?\nStudents transferring to Sunmarke School from Regent International School, will not be required to pay additional Assessment or Registration fees.
